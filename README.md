# Fake_News_Detection

Overview
This repository contains code for a fake news detection project. The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between fake and real news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to create a reliable tool for identifying misinformation in textual content.

Features
Data preprocessing: The project includes scripts for cleaning and preprocessing textual data to prepare it for machine learning tasks.
Feature extraction: Various features such as word embeddings, TF-IDF vectors, and other linguistic features are extracted from the text to represent articles in a machine-readable format.
Model training: Different machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks are implemented and trained on labeled datasets for fake news detection.
Evaluation: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on validation and test datasets.
Deployment: Instructions and scripts for deploying the trained model as an API or integrating it into other applications are provided.
Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset containing labeled examples of fake and real news articles. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
TensorFlow (optional, for neural network models)
Flask (optional, for API deployment)
